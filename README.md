Welcome to the source code for the game who's working name is Loose Threads.

### What is this repository for? ###
This Repository is to help you set up your development Enviroment so you can pull the code onto your machine and run the game straight from source.


### How do I get set up? ###

* You will need OpenJdk version 1.8.0_65 as of right now. 
* You will also need to get Eclipse Java Mars and the Android Development Kit and the Eclipse plugin for that, and the eclipse plugin for gradle.
* Import the gradle repository, and make sure it imports 4 projects, LooseThreads, LooseThreads-core, LooseThreads-Android, LooseThreads-Desktop.
* Dependencies will be downloaded automatically and kept up to date with your build, thanks to gradle.
* Deployment will be handled by the admin of the project, however if you would like to deploy your own version, Select(in eclipse) the project labeled with *-Desktop, then go to File>Export and select Java>Runnable Jar File. Hit next, then make sure to extract required libraries into the Jar option, and hit finish. It will save wherever you tell it to.
