/* 		This class will read in data from maps, and find where monsters are located, based off of where
 * they are on the map. We will do this by adding a layer in the map on tiled. Objects drawn on that 
 * particular level will be the spawn points for each monster. We will work on different properties
 * drawing different monster when Lucas and I(Tyler) can talk more about this, however the monster 
 * manager will handle monsters that should be loaded on the beginning of the level and also will have
 * the ablility to spawn new monsters based off of scripted events.
